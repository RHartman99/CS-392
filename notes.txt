/////////////

C vs Java: Java compile once run anywhere, C write once compile anywhere

#include "stdbool.h"
#include "stdio.h"

We can use implicit casts when we are going from smaller to larger (int -> float), because there will be no issue. The problem is when you cast down, and run the risk of overflowing.

unsigned int var3 = -1 // Max unsigned integer

#define PI 3.14 // Preprocessor directive to make a constant by macro. They aren't checked! They're just text replacements

float pi = PI;

////////

To swap we need to know:

The indices
The size of the data type
Swap a bunch of char* with each data type, swapping
every byte until swapping all the contents
